Map Reduce
Wikipedia states (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce): 
MapReduce is useful in a wide range of applications, including distributed pattern-based searching, distributed sorting, web link-graph reversal, Singular Value Decomposition,[9] web access log stats, inverted index construction, document clustering, machine learning,[10]and statistical machine translation. Moreover, the MapReduce model has been adapted to several computing environments like multi-core and many-core systems,[11][12][13] desktop grids,[14] volunteer computing environments,[15] dynamic cloud environments,[16] and mobile environments.[17]
