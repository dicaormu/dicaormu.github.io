This is the first post of what I hope, became a group of post for beginners in __bigdata__ and new __distributed applications__.

First of all, I am going to speak about methodology, because, what can we do if we don't have the right methodology ? we will be irresponsible if we say _"my big data project will be totally ready in 1 month"_.

When we work for a company, it is very important to know the budget and the delay of a project, but the classic methodology of V-cycle, is not advised anymore. Why? because most of the time requirements and technologies evolve rapidly and one should have the client or the product owner very close to review and feed constantly the project. I want to be clear, if one want to succeed, we should follow the project evolution very close, and that is only reached with an agile methodology.

I am going to speak in __scrum__ terms, because that is what I know. Scrum divides the project in many short sprints. 
If we come from a classic methodology, it is common to think that for each sprint (3 or 4 weeks), we deliver a part of the project. That is in part true, but you have to be careful. This part must be a functional one. I mean: if we are going to build this car :

<img src="/assets/images/version4.jpeg" />

 In the first sprint we should deliver a version of the car that I can drive, not just the engine or the wheels, as I show in the image.

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
 			<img src="/assets/images/version1.jpg" width="140" height="120" />
 		</td>
 		<td>
 			<img src="/assets/images/version2.jpg" width="140" height="120" />
 		</td>
 		<td>
 			<img src="/assets/images/version3.jpeg" width="140" height="120" />
 		</td>
 		<td>
		 	<img src="/assets/images/version4.jpeg" width="140" height="120" />
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Version 1
		</td>
		<td>
			Version 2
		</td>
		<td>
			Version 3
		</td>
		<td>
			Version 4
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Each version is functional, even if the first version is far of being the beautiful version that the product owner wanted.
With each sprint we have the opportunity of adjusting the requirements and at the end, we can have the right version for the client and we avoid the famous joke of software engineering <img src="http://rslblog.zonapersonal.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Columpio-Igeniria-de-software-con-vi%C3%B1etas.png"  />.
